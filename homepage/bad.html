                <p> Hi <span>👋🏾</span>, my name is Saadman. I am a 4th year comp sci student at the UofA. I like coding!</p>

                <h1>My History <span>📜</span></h1>
                <p>I started out my first job in tech as a Teaching assistant for a C programming course at the university of Alberta. In the following year
                    I got my first Co-op job as a software developer intern at Clio. I was on the backend infrastructure team and got tons of experience working with 
                    ruby on rails. As my second co-op, I was a full stack developer at HSBC. The tech stack included react and springboot. I got to learn and contribute a lot to the 
                    wealth compass platform for HSBC. It was a very fun and valuable experience.
